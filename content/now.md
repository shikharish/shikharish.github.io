>(This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page. Basically what I have been up to lately.)

- My mid semester exams just got over and have planned a lot of things for the coming months.
- Had applied for LFX Mentorship. Chances of selections are slim. Would get to know in about a week.
- Recently worked on [IQPS](https://github.com/metakgp/iqps) with seniors at MetaKGP. We released the beta version because mid-sem exams were near, but a lot of work still needs to be done.
- Currently reading [The Secret History](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13054604-the-secret-history).
