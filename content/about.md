Hello there!

I am Shikhar Soni, a first year Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate student at IIT Kharagpur. Computers, coding, open-source, and anything tech-related excites me. I am fascinated by the idealogy of open-source and have been trying to contribute to some projects. I am an active member of [MetaKGP](https://github.com/metakgp), an open community of students working on useful projects to solve day-to-day problems faced by KGPians.

**_"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."_** - Leonardo da Vinci

**_"In character, in manner, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity."_** - Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

These quotes have been the driving force of my life lately. While writing code or solving a physics problem, I actively try to make the solution as simple as possible. And it often pays off, giving extra time to work that out. That is why I enjoy writing in Go so much, with its focus on simplicity.

Outside the world of syntax and logic, I like to take photographs. I find calm in visiting places, taking pictures, and capturing moments. I am also a member of [TFPS](https://www.instagram.com/tfps.iitkgp/), the film-making and photography society of IIT-KGP and have met some amazing photographers here. Check out some of my pictures in the [gallery](https://shikharish.github.io/gallery).

P.S., Creating and maintaining this site is one of my resolutions for 2024. I hope it works well :)
